# Boreal
[Boreal](https://adalab.github.io/Boreal/) is an issues monitor for [Taiga](https://taiga.io/) , a management platform for agile projects created by [Kaleidos](http://kaleidos.net/).
## But, what it is for?
With Boreal you can
  + Follow the last five created/changed issues of your project.
  + Visualize  how many issues you have closed or open and the percentage of those open issues by default type.
  + Visualize charts of your issues by priority and severity.
  + Find out who is the user with most issues assigned over time on your project.
  + Visualize the number of issues that have not been assigned yet.
## How does it work?
  Easy! you just have to type the slug of your project in the search input and the magic happens!
  ### Ehmm... slug?!
  The **slug** of your project appears on the URL.
  For example for our Taiga project the URL would be: https://tree.taiga.io/project/altheae-taigaadalab/.
  #### Copy the similar text in bold from your URL and paste it on the login page!
  tree.taiga.io/project/**altheae-taigaadalab**
